# add_new_wifi.sh
This script automates the process of adding new Wi-Fi network configurations to the wpa_supplicant.conf file on a FreeBSD system, without requiring direct file modification. This is particularly beneficial in office spaces or comparable locations where quick and secure network additions are needed.
